e.g. If we want to find all pairs of students who have the same GPA => we need 2 instances of Student table.

SELECT *
FROM Student S1, Student S2
WHERE S1.sID = S2.sID       /*explitic join required in SQL
AND S1.GPA = S2.GPA
AND S1.sID < S2.sID;         /*so we do not match the same person - we want distinct


e.g. We want all ID of students who applied for major CS and EE

SELECT DISTINCT sID
FROM Apply A1, Apply A2
WHERE A1.sID = A2.sID AND A1.major = 'CS' AND A2.major = 'EE';


e.g. Find all sID of students hwo applied major CS BUT NOT major EE

SELECT sID FROM Apply where major = 'CS'
EXCEPT
SELECT sID FROM Apply wher major = 'EE';
